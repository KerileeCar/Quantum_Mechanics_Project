## Running the code
By running the Interface.py file, a Tkinter GUI screen will appear. 

This screen allows the user to choose between the Classical Method, Quantum Simulation and Quantum hardware. 
Once a selection has been made, fill in the default probabilities for each asset, as well as the number of qubits to represent Z, if required. 

To generate the Total Loss Distribution bar chart as well as the total expected loss, press the Calculate button.
